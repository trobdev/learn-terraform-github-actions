Integrating GH actions w/ Terraform and AWS

First time demonstrating use of GH Actions using demo at https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/github-actions?in=terraform/automation.  Used TF Cloud to create a new workspace, add my AWS creds, and generate an API token to link to GH.  Setup a repo, created a main.tf in a forked branch which I pushed to be merged to main.  I pulled & merged, and watched the workflow complete in GH actions & TF Cloud.
